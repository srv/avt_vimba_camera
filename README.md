# CARMAAvtVimbaDriver
This is a fork of a third party driver developed for video camera operation.  It is modified for CARMA-specific use.  The master repo, located [here](https://github.com/srv/avt_vimba_camera), had no readme for its home page, so this readme is added to the fork to describe how this repo fits into the rest of the CARMA environment.

# CARMAPlatform
The primary CARMAPlatform repository can be found [here](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-platform) and is part of the [USDOT FHWA STOL](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/)
github organization. Documentation on how the CARMAPlatform functions, how it will evolve over time, and how you can contribute can be found at the above links as well
